=================================
First Debugger and Arcade Windows
=================================

Let's start writing our game by opening a window. Along the way,
we'll have our first debugger experience.

Objectives
==========

- Run a program under the debugger, instead of directly in Python

- Open a game window with a title and correct size

Steps
=====

#. Change the main block to have two lines that use Arcade:

   .. literalinclude:: game.py
        :language: python
        :linenos:

#. Click the green arrow on line 3 and choose ``Run``.

#. A new window appears. It's our game!

#. Close the window.

What's Going On

- What it means to run under the debugger

- Cython speedups

- pyglet window in another window
