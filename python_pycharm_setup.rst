============
Python Setup
============

We're writing games in Python, so that means we need a Python setup.
In this section, we'll download and install Python, get an editor to
use for our coding, and create a project.

.. note::

    This tutorial focuses on Windows, but everything covered
    works fine on macOS and Linux as well.

Python
======

Installing Python on Windows is quite easy. Head to the
`Python download page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
and follow the instructions to download Python 3.6.1 (or higher.)
During the install, make sure to click the checkbox on the first screen
to put Python in the Windows ``PATH``.

PyCharm
=======

When you're writing code, you need a tool that helps you with your
Python. This tutorial uses the free and open source program called
`PyCharm Community Edition <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_.
PyCharm is an IDE (integrated development environment) and the Community
Edition has everything we need for writing a game and doing visual
debugging.

There's a lot to learn, but don't worry, we'll introduce it gradually.

Project
=======

As PyCharm is launching, it will ask you to create a new *project*. Let's
make one called ``Arcade Tutorial``. Let's also make a
*virtual environment*. When working on projects in Python, you
often install *packages* which others have published. You don't want
packages for one project to conflict with another. Virtual environments
give this kind of isolation.

TODO give the steps needed for creating the project
