Conditional Breakpoints and Animation
=====================================

- Conditional BP to solve startup

- Stop on exception (perhaps draw_text with y instead of message?)

- Investigate the f-string

Game:

- Set an initial position

- Change the string being displayed

- Implement animation via Arcade's ``update`` method
