This tutorial started life as a 3 hour EuroPython session: hands-on,
focused on learning to debug *visually*, and doing so by having fun.
Writing games is fun. Learning debugging by writing games? Even more fun!

This tutorial teaches *visual* debugging, *visually*:

- Instead of command-line pdb (eat your broccoli),  we use the
  visual debugger in PyCharm Community Edition

- Instead of boring hello world Python with prime numbers, we gradually
  write a 2d game, with each step teaching both a debugging concept and
  writing some of the game

We go through many of the elements of a game: getting something on the
screen, drawing text, animation, shapes, motion, collisions,
keeping score, etc. But along the way, we are introducing debugging:
breakpoints, stepping, watches, stack frames, etc.

What makes this tutorial different?

- Hands-on, where you write code for each segment.

- Working code for every segment lets you avoid getting lost.

Let's begin by getting ourselves setup.
