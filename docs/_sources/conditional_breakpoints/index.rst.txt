=====================================
Conditional Breakpoints and Animation
=====================================

- Conditional BP to solve startup

- Stop on exception (perhaps draw_text with y instead of message?)

- Investigate the f-string

- Manage all breakpoints

- Shut up all breakpoints

- What's up with the delta_time argument?

Game:

- Set an initial position

- Change the string being displayed

- Implement animation via Arcade's ``update`` method

Steps
=====

#. Edit ``game.py`` to have the following:s

   .. literalinclude:: game.py
        :language: python
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 9, 13-15, 17-18

   - *Line 9*. We will constantly update the position of the label, so
     let's initialize it with a starting position.

   - *Line 13*. Center the text on the screen height.

   - *Line 14-15*. Use Python 3.6 f-strings to make a label and draw it to
     the middle of the screen. Note that this is going to change every time
     line 18 updates the position.

   - *Line 18*. Move the position one pixel to the right. This gets called
     "a lot" by Arcade (where "a lot" can be configured.)
