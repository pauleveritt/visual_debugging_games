- Variable explorer and inline values

Objectives

- Move breakpoints without restarting

Steps
=====

#. Edit ``game.py`` to have the following:s

   .. literalinclude:: game.py
        :language: python
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 4-12, 16, 18

   - *Line 4*. Arcade games are usually classes that fill in magic methods.
     Here we make a subclass of Arcade's ``Window`` base class.

   - *Lines 5-6*. Pass in window information, then give to the base class.

   - *Lines 10-12*. The magic method ``on_draw`` is called many times per
     second, to perform graphics operations.

   - *Line 16*. Make an instance of the game (then return it, in case you
     want to test the ``main`` function.)
